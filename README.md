The build and acceptance test will be performed when the branch is pushed. See the [build report](http://gradle-ssh-plugin.github.io/build-report.html) of every branches.


### Known issues

1 test will be failed on Mac OS X, due to a bug of JSch to handle a hashed `known_hosts` on Mac OS X.

2 tests will be failed on Windows, because Apache sshd server does not support SFTP operations on Windows.


Acceptance Test
---------------

We can run acceptance tests to verify behavior of the plugin on Gradle environment.

Prerequisite:

* SSH service must be started on localhost port 22
* Current user must be able to log in with a private key placed at `~/.ssh/id_rsa` without any passphrase
* SSH service must accept SFTP subsystem

Upload a built JAR into the local repository and invoke a test.

```bash
./gradlew uploadArchives
./gradlew -p acceptance-tests -i test
```

### Aggressive tests

Above does not contain aggressive tests such as creating users or changing system configration.
Invoke with aggressiveTest to run aggressive tests.
It is strongly recommended to run on a disposable instance such as Travis CI.

```bash
./gradlew -p acceptance-tests -i aggressiveTest
```


Publish to Bintray
------------------

Prerequisite:

* `~/.gradle/gradle.properties` must contain 
  * bintrayUser
  * bintrayKey

Invoke the upload task:

```bash
./gradlew bintrayUpload
```
